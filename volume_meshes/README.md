I downloaded the VNC neuropil region meshes and tract meshes in `.obj` format from Virtual Fly Brain. [Here's a direct VFB link](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto?id=Court2020&i=VFB_00200000,VFB_00104653,VFB_00104635,VFB_00104652,VFB_00104651,VFB_00104650,VFB_00104649,VFB_00104648,VFB_00104647,VFB_00104646,VFB_00104645,VFB_00104644,VFB_00104643,VFB_00104642,VFB_00104641,VFB_00104640,VFB_00104639,VFB_00104638,VFB_00104637,VFB_00104636,VFB_00104634,VFB_00104633) with the regions and tracts loaded into their 3D viewer. You can go to the `Layers` tab, click on the region or tract you're interested in which will jump you to the `Term Info` tab for that object, then scroll down to the `Downloads` section and download the `Mesh/Pointcloud (OBJ)`.

(Unfortunately, these are aligned to the unisex template, not the female template. I'm asking Rob at VFB to try to get ones aligned to the female template.)

Once downloaded, I opened the .obj file in meshlab, deleted any connected components that weren't attached to the main mesh, scaled things up by 1000x to go from microns to nm, then saved as an .stl with binary encoding. (I only know how to open .stl files in python, via the numpy-stl package, but if you know of ways to open other types, feel free to work with a format you're most familiar with.) Then, I warped the mesh from `JRC2018_VNC_UNISEX` space to FANC space by running:

    ./warp_mesh_to_FANC.py "JRC2018_VNC_UNISEX/VFB_00104653 wing tectulum_cleaned_1000x.stl" JRC2018_VNC_UNISEX_to_FANC
