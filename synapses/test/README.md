On Feb 7 2020, Ran extracted synaptic links for the left+right T1 neuromeres cutout. These links are stored at [gs://ranl_scratch_zetta_30/seg_test/8a1a48c796b94e53946cec166de725e2](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/ranl_scratch_zetta_30/seg_test/8a1a48c796b94e53946cec166de725e2) (only 30 day storage for now!). The links are stored in binary files each representing all synaptic links within a certain chunk of the image volume, with the same chunk filename convention as cloudvolume. Load the files as numpy arrays with `np.fromfile(filename, dtype=np.uint32).reshape(-1, 6)`. Or if you want to put these into a neuroglancer annotation layer, run from your terminal `python copy_saved_links_for_ng.py filename`. I put an example file from that bucket into this folder, so to test this out you can run `python copy_saved_links_for_ng.py extracted_links/12740-13252_52216-52728_2096-2224`. Then go to neuroglancer, create an empty annotation layer, open up the json state, open `"layers"`, open the row corresponding to your empty annotation layer, and paste the string that the script above output into the `"annotations": []` row, making sure to **replace** the existing `[]` with your copied text. (The copied text includes the starting and ending brackets, so you need to delete the existing `[]` to make sure to only have it once.) If you did this right, you should end up with a state that looks something [like this](https://neuromancer-seung-import.appspot.com/?json_url=https://api.zetta.ai/json/101373223527718115).
