The complete set of 52.7 million synaptic links is available through:
* CAVEclient in a table named [synapses_jan2022](https://cave.fanc-fly.com/annotation/views/aligned_volume/fanc_v4/table/synapses_jan2022)
* Google drive as a 4.25GB .csv file: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L7Zp2ek0At14b-dqe-g06ZNo9JH3Wxda)


Those 52.7 million links were filtered down from a larger set of ~85 million links using a synapse score threshold. TODO include details on that thresholding. The full set of ~85 million links can be found in the google cloud storage bucket [gs://zetta_lee_fly_vnc_001_alignment_temp/v4/fill_nearest_mip1/img/img_seethrough/synful_extraction/229bd2f77b2adf7c0e2c5b90ed605098/8.6_8.6_45/](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/zetta_lee_fly_vnc_001_alignment_temp/v4/fill_nearest_mip1/img/img_seethrough/synful_extraction/229bd2f77b2adf7c0e2c5b90ed605098/8.6_8.6_45)
