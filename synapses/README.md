The complete set of 56.5 million synaptic links is available through CAVEclient in a table named [synapses_may2021](https://cave.fanc-fly.com/annotation/views/aligned_volume/fanc_v4/table/synapses_may2021)

Those 56.5 million links were filtered down from a larger set of ~85 million links using a synapse score threshold. TODO include details on that thresholding. The full set of ~85 million links can be found in the google bucket [gs://zetta_lee_fly_vnc_001_alignment_temp/v4/fill_nearest_mip1/img/img_seethrough/synful_extraction/7bbd8e23ab3f0f504f53c2f954af7f9c/8.6_8.6_45](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/zetta_lee_fly_vnc_001_alignment_temp/v4/fill_nearest_mip1/img/img_seethrough/synful_extraction/7bbd8e23ab3f0f504f53c2f954af7f9c/8.6_8.6_45)
