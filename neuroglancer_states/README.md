## Neuroglancer states

Each file here specifies a neuroglancer state, through which you can view FANC neurons in different ways. To load one of these states, go to the url `https://ng.fanc.community/{filename}` where you replace `{filename}` with the name of one of the files in this folder (without the `.json` at the end). Here are some links to get you started:

- https://ng.fanc.community/published-neurons-viewer
- https://ng.fanc.community/published-neurons-aligned-to-template-viewer

(If ever these shorten links aren't working, try using the full URL, which is `https://spelunker.cave-explorer.org/#!https://raw.githubusercontent.com/htem/FANC_auto_recon/main/neuroglancer_states/{filename}`)
