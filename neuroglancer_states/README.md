## Neuroglancer states

Each file here specifies a neuroglancer state, through which you can view FANC neurons in different ways. To load one of these states, go to the url `https://spelunker.cave-explorer.org/#!https://ngstate.fanc.community/{filename}` where you replace `{filename}` with the name of one of the files in this folder. Here are some links to get you started:

- [public-neurons-viewer](https://spelunker.cave-explorer.org/#!https://ngstate.fanc.community/public-neurons-viewer)
- [public-neurons-aligned-to-template-viewer](https://spelunker.cave-explorer.org/#!https://ngstate.fanc.community/public-neurons-aligned-to-template-viewer)

(If ever these shortened links that include `https://ngstate.fanc.community/` aren't working, you can replace that portion of the link with the full path to the files in this folder, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/htem/FANC_auto_recon/main/neuroglancer_states/`)
